This describes how to compile ssNake on windows 7, and make an installer.

==================
   Requirements
==================
Python with all relevant libraries
pyinstaller (can be get via pip)
NSIS installer maker (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/)

==================
      Steps
==================
- Copy the files in this directory to the same level as the ssnake folder
- In buildssNake.bat: change the path of the pyinstaller.exe to the path on your machine
- In ssNake.spec: change the basePath to point to the ssNake src directory
- In ssNake.spec: change the entry in 'pathex' to the scipy extra dll's
- Run 'buildssNake.bat' and check if this works (takes some time)
- If ssNake is build successfully, the dist directory contains the compiled version. Test
  'ssNake.exe' to see if the compilation went correctly.
- Run 'makeInstaller.bat' to bundle the ssNake files to an installer
- If these steps work correctly, the 'builAll.bat' script can be used in the future, to compile
  ssNake, make the installer, and remove the compiled files.
