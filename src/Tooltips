GetPos	Get the position of a data point.	Get the x, y, and amplitude values for a position selected in the main plot. The result is printed to the right of this button, in both axis units and the number of the data point. Also shown is the difference with respect to the previous pick. Note that 'amp' is the intensity of the selected point. The 'y' value only appears for plot in which 3D data is plot (i.e. a contour plot).
Fourier	Perform a Fourier transformation of the current dimension.	ssNake uses the time/freq toggle to figure out whether to do a normal or an inverse transform. After the transform, the applicable FFT shift is also applied.
xPosition	Displays the x-position of the last pick.	The displayed number is the position of the data point along the x-axis. Note that, in ssNake, position '0' always refers to the first data point. Also note that, in a spectrum, the data indices go from the right to the left, making point '0' the rightmost data point.
xValue	Displays the x-value of the last pick.	The displayed number is the axis value of the selected data point along the x-axis in the unit of the x-axis. 
ampValue	Displays the amplitude value of the last pick.	The displayed number is the amplitude that belongs to the selected data point. Note that the amplitude of a data point is not always equal to the y-value in the plot. For example, in a contour plot it stands for the z-value of the data point. 
deltaxvalue	Displays the difference in x-value between the last two picks.	The difference is between the axis values (i.e. in Hz, s, ppm, etc.), and is given in the unit of the x-axis.
deltaamplitude	Displays the difference in amplitude between the last two picks.

yPosition	Displays the y-position of the last pick.	The displayed number is the position of the data point along the y-axis. Note that, in ssNake, position '0' always refers to the first data point. Also note that, in a spectrum, the data indices go from the top to the bottom, making point '0' the uppermost data point.
yValue	Displays the y-value of the last pick.	The displayed number is the axis value of the selected data point along the y-axis in the unit of the y-axis. 
deltayvalue	Displays the difference in y-value between the last two picks.	The difference is between the axis values (i.e. in Hz, s, ppm, etc.), and is given in the unit of the y-axis.
